# 001Key

Custom 75% Keyboard.

## Hardware

- Teensy 4.1 development board
- SSD1306 0.96 Inch OLED Display
- MX & Alps switch support
- Backlight (single color)

## Firmware

Custom firmware, has OLED, backlight and layer support.

Currently  no key debounce programmed in yet.

This is my first c++ project, im used to C# development, so all this stuff about header files and pointers are kinda new to me, expect some weird programming choices.

On that note; feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you think something is wrong. ðŸ˜‰
