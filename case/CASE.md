## Acrylic case

The acrylic case can be assembled using M2 standoffs (thin,non-hex), use both male-to-female and female-to-female combined to get the correct lengths.

The svg file names should be pretty self-explanatory but here is another summary:

|File|Material|Thickness|Amount|
|---|---|---|---|
|1-foot_4mm_acrylic_x2.svg|Acrylic|4mm|0 - 2|
|2-bottom_5mm_acrylic_x1.svg|Acrylic|5mm|1|
|3-closed_4mm_acrylic_x3.svg|Acrylic|4mm|3|
|4-spacer_2mm_acrylic_x1.svg|Acrylic|2mm|1|
|5-plate_1.5mm_pom_x1.svg|POM|1.5mm|1|
|6-top_usb_3mm_acrylic_x2.svg|Acrylic|3mm|2|
|7-top_2mm_acrylic_x1.svg|Acrylic|2mm|1|

## Manufacturer

You might need to change the coloring and layers of the svg files to the specification of your manufacturer. 
You do have many color choices when using acrylic so let your imagination go wild!

If you're in europe I can recommend [snijlab.nl](https://snijlab.nl) and [laserbeest.nl](https://www.laserbeest.nl/).

For international I heard good things about [ponoko.com](https://www.ponoko.com/).

## Notes

You will have to bend your mosfet into an S-shape so it lays flat on the board.

## Anti-Flex

This part can be 3d printed and screwed to bottom of the top 6 holes of the pcb to provide some stability and to prevent the plate and pcb from flexing too much.

Depending on the calibration of your pinter you might need to tweak the length of the model (you can insert a pause at heigh and stop the print if its too long).

You can experiment yourself if you place them in all 6 holes or any other number of holes.
