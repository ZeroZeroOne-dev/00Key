## Plates

The top and bottom plate can be attached to the pcb using M2 standoffs (hex) both male-to-female and female-to-female. 

For the bottom you can choose yourself how long the standoffs you want to use are.
(Take into account if you want to put rgb strips in and if you do if you want to use the 3d-printable bracket, you can always switch them around later)

For the top you have to take into account the chosen height for the oled screen and in what position you put your mosfet (S-bended or upright).

The bottom plate can either be cut in 5mm acrylic (3mm might also work but i like the extra weight) or 3d printed.

The top plate should be cut in acrylic (2mm minimum for strength).
